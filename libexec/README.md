# libexec

The content of this directory will automatically be ignored (as it starts with
`lib`). It is meant to contain contributed modules of various sorts. These can
be used for executables that are automatically run at installation time, or
picked up by these to provide for additional functionality (see
[bin](../bin/linkin.sh) for an example script)
